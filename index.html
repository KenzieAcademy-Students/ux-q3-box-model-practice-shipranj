            >By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox
            (Vulpes vulpes), although various species are found on almost every
            continent. The presence of fox-like carnivores all over the globe
            has led to their appearance in both popular culture and folklore in
            many cultures around the world (see also Foxes in culture). The gray
            fox is one of only two canine species known to climb trees; the
            other is the raccoon dog.</span
